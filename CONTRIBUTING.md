# Contributing to Go Template

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project follows a set of guidelines to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PlatformStackPulse/go-template.git
   cd go-template
   ```

3. **Setup development environment:**
   ```bash
   make dev-setup
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Before You Start

- Review existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicates
- Open an issue first for significant changes
- Discuss your approach with maintainers

### Making Changes

1. **Ensure tests pass:**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

2. **Follow code style:**
   ```bash
   make fmt lint
   ```

3. **Run security checks:**
   ```bash
   make security
   ```

4. **Commit with conventional format:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue"
   ```

### Conventional Commits

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat` — A new feature
- `fix` — A bug fix
- `docs` — Documentation only changes
- `style` — Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` — Code change that neither fixes bugs nor adds features
- `perf` — Code change that improves performance
- `test` — Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore` — Changes to build process, dependencies, etc.
- `ci` — Changes to CI configuration
- `build` — Changes to build system

**Examples:**
```
feat: add support for feature flags
feat(cli): add hello command
fix: resolve nil pointer exception
fix(logger): fix timestamp formatting
docs: update README with examples
chore: upgrade Go to 1.22
```

## Testing

### Write Tests

- Add tests for new features
- Update tests for bug fixes
- Follow table-driven test pattern
- Use `testify` for assertions

```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
    }{
        {
            name:     "test case 1",
            input:    "input",
            expected: "output",
        },
    }

    for _, tc := range tests {
        t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := MySomething(tc.input)
            assert.Equal(t, tc.expected, result)
        })
    }
}
```

### Run Tests Before Submitting

```bash
make test           # Run all tests
make test-unit      # Unit tests only
make test-integration # Integration tests only
make coverage       # Generate coverage report
```

## Code Style

### Go Code

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Run `golangci-lint` regularly

```bash
make fmt
make lint
```

### File Organization

```

├── domain/         # Domain entities
├── usecase/        # Business logic
├── adapter/        # External integrations
├── cli/            # CLI commands
